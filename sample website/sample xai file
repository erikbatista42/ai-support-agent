INTEGRATIONS

## **Google Analytics**

### **Description**
When enabled, it tracks user interactions, page views, and custom events on the website. The gtag.js script is loaded asynchronously and initialized with a measurement ID.

### **Additional information**
This integration uses the Global Site Tag (gtag.js) which is the modern implementation of Google Analytics. It automatically tracks pageviews on load and can be configured to track custom events. The script loads from googletagmanager.com and requires a valid measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX). When properly configured, you should see network requests to google-analytics.com/g/collect.

## **Intercom**

### **Description**
When enabled, it adds a live chat widget to the website, typically appearing as a messenger icon in the bottom-right corner. Users can click to initiate conversations with support or view automated messages.

### **Additional information**
The Intercom widget is loaded asynchronously and requires an app_id to initialize. It provides real-time messaging capabilities and can be customized with user data via the intercomSettings object. The widget automatically attaches itself to the page and maintains its state across page loads. The script loads from widget.intercom.io and the API communicates through api-iam.intercom.io.

## **Segment**

### **Description**
When enabled, it serves as a customer data platform that collects analytics events and routes them to multiple destinations. It provides a unified API for tracking user behavior across different analytics tools.

### **Additional information**
Segment loads the analytics.js library which provides methods like page(), track(), identify(), and more. The integration requires a write key for authentication and automatically tracks the initial page view on load. It acts as a single integration point that can forward data to hundreds of other tools without additional code changes. The script loads from cdn.segment.com.

## **Sentry**

### **Description**
When enabled, it captures JavaScript errors, unhandled promise rejections, and performance issues in real-time. It provides detailed error reports including stack traces, breadcrumbs, and contextual information.

### **Additional information**
Sentry is initialized with a DSN (Data Source Name) that identifies the project where errors should be sent. The integration includes browser tracing capabilities for performance monitoring. It automatically captures errors but can also be used to manually capture exceptions. When making requests to Sentry ingest endpoints (o0.ingest.sentry.io), successful initialization returns a 200 response. The browser SDK is loaded from browser.sentry-cdn.com.

## **Hotjar**

### **Description**
When enabled, it records user sessions, tracks heatmaps, and collects feedback through polls and surveys. It provides insights into how users interact with the website through visual representations.

### **Additional information**
Hotjar initializes with a site ID (hjid) and a script version number (hjsv). The script creates a global hj object that queues commands until the full script loads. It runs asynchronously to avoid blocking page load. Session recordings and heatmap data are sent to Hotjar's servers for analysis. The integration loads from static.hotjar.com and requires a valid site ID (numeric format).
