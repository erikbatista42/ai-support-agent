## **Integration name:** Featurebase **Description** When enabled, it adds a live chat widget to the website, typically appearing as a messenger icon in the bottom-right corner. Users can click to initiate conversations with support or view automated messages.

### **Additional information** To initialize this widget, you must give it an app\_id.

* ### It is expected the customer gets the app\_id and gives it support to install.

* ### If the widget is installed properly and the issue appears to be relevant to the Intercom widget itself, reach out to [support@featurebase.com](mailto:support@intercom.com)
